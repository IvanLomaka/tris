# Tris (Tic-Tac-Toe)

Website: https://tic-tac-toe-minimax-ai.netlify.app/

A Tic-Tac-Toe game with minimax algorithm implementation for AI player.

## Project Overview

This project was created in February 2021 during my second year of liceo as my first semi-large JavaScript project. It implements a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game with both two-player and AI opponent options.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the game's interface, including the game board, controls, and modal dialogs.
- **CSS3**: Implemented for styling the game with:
  - Custom game board design
  - Responsive layout
  - Modal popup for game results
  - Animation transitions
  - Google Fonts integration
  - User interface elements (buttons, counters)
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language used to create all the game logic:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Game state management
  - AI opponent using the minimax algorithm
  - Timer functionality

## Key Features

- Choice between playing against the computer or another player
- Player can choose to play as X or O
- Game statistics tracking (wins, ties, time)
- Timer to track game duration
- Responsive design
- Modal popup for game results
- Option to play again or return to the home screen

## What I Learned

### Programming Concepts
- **Artificial Intelligence Basics**: Implemented the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI opponent
- **Recursive Programming**: Used recursion within the minimax function to explore all possible game states
- **Object-Oriented JavaScript**: Utilized objects to manage game state and player information
- **Game Theory**: Applied concepts of game theory to create optimal AI moves

### Web Development Skills
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to update the UI dynamically based on game state
- **Event Handling**: Implemented click events and user interactions
- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Created a responsive game board and UI elements
- **Modal Implementation**: Built a custom modal system for displaying game results
- **Timer Implementation**: Created a timer system to track game duration

### Software Engineering Practices
- **State Management**: Managed game state across different components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organized code to separate UI, game logic, and AI algorithms
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Translated the minimax algorithm theory into working code
- **User Experience Design**: Created an intuitive interface for player interaction

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels to the AI
- Implement local storage to save game statistics
- Add animations for winning combinations
- Create a responsive design for mobile devices
- Add sound effects

*This project represents my first significant experience with JavaScript, laying the foundation for my interest in web development and game programming.*
